    "\n",
    "Selecting the right model is the first step in any AI solution. Azure AI Foundry provides a **Model Catalog** in its portal that lists hundreds of models across providers (Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta, Hugging Face, etc.). In this section, we'll see how to find and select models via:\n",
    "- **Azure AI Foundry Portal** 🎨 (visual interface)\n",
    "- **Azure SDK (Python)** 🤖 (programmatic approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Browsing Models in Azure AI Foundry Portal \n",
    "In the Azure AI Foundry portal, navigate to **Model catalog**. You can:\n",
    "1. **Search or filter** models by provider, capability, or use-case (e.g., *Curated by Azure AI*, *Azure OpenAI*, *Hugging Face* filters).\n",
    "2. Click on a model tile to view details like description, input/output formats, and usage guidelines.\n",
    "3. **Deploy** the model to your project or use it directly if it’s a hosted service (for Azure OpenAI models, ensure you have them deployed in your Azure OpenAI resource).\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Tip:** Models from Azure OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4, Ada) need an Azure OpenAI deployment. Other models (like open models from Hugging Face) can be deployed on managed endpoints in Foundry. Always check if a model requires deployment or is immediately usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤖 Listing Models via SDK\n",
    "Using the Azure AI Projects SDK (`azure-ai-projects`), we can programmatically retrieve available models in our project. This helps ensure our code is using the correct model names and deployments.\n",

    "- **Responsible AI principles**: Align with fairness, reliability & safety, privacy, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. Use Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard as a guide (Identify potential harms, Measure them, Mitigate with tools like content filters, and Plan for ongoing Operation).\n",
    "- **Access control**: Use Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can deploy or invoke models. Separate development, testing, and production with proper approvals.\n",
    "- **Data governance**: Ensure no sensitive data is used in prompts or stored in logs. Anonymize or avoid personal data. Use Content Safety and ProtectedMaterial evaluators to catch leaks.\n",
    "- **Continuous monitoring**: Leverage telemetry and evaluation metrics in production. For example, track the rate of content safety flags or low groundedness scores over time, and set up alerts if they spike.\n",
    "- **Feedback loops**: Allow users to report bad answers. Periodically retrain or adjust prompts based on real-world usage and known failure cases.\n",
    "- **Indirect Attack Evaluation**: Additionally, simulate indirect attack jailbreaks by injecting malicious context or altering user queries to test the resilience of the RAG pipeline. This helps identify vulnerabilities that can lead to unexpected behavior or information leakage.\n",
    "- **Documentation and transparency**: Document how the model should and should not be used. Provide disclaimers about limitations. This aligns with transparency in Responsible AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎉 By following these practices – selecting the right model, rigorously evaluating for safety, security, and quality, and monitoring in production – you can build AI solutions that are not only powerful but also trustworthy and compliant. Happy building! 🎯"

    "\n",
    "In this section, we demonstrate a **basic RAG** flow using the Azure AI Projects SDK along with Azure AI Search. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where an LLM leverages external data—retrieved via vector or hybrid search—to ground its responses, thereby reducing hallucinations and improving answer relevance.\n",

    "> ```bash\n",
    "> pip install azure-search-documents\n",
    "> ```\n",

    "For example, you might store a set of AI safety guidelines and best practices in a search index, and then, upon receiving a user query about security or responsible AI, retrieve the most relevant documents. These documents are passed as context to the LLM to generate a final, informed answer grounded in established practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this notebook demonstrates how indirect attack jailbreaks can occur in the RAG pipeline by injecting malicious context or modifying user queries. Such adversarial manipulations can lead to altered or unexpected behaviors, and are simulated using our indirect attack adversarial framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluators for RAG\n",
    "When evaluating RAG systems, the following evaluators are particularly relevant:\n",
    "- **RelevanceEvaluator**: Assesses if the retrieved documents are relevant to the query.\n",
    "- **CoherenceEvaluator**: Checks if the final generated response is coherent with the provided context.\n",
    "- **GroundednessEvaluator**: Evaluates how well the response is anchored in the retrieved information.\n",
    "- **FluencyEvaluator** and **BleuScoreEvaluator**: Help assess the linguistic quality of the generated output.\n",
    "\n",
    "These evaluators provide insights into the effectiveness of both the retrieval and generation stages of your RAG pipeline. For AI safety content, it's particularly important to ensure high groundedness scores to maintain the accuracy of security and governance recommendations."
