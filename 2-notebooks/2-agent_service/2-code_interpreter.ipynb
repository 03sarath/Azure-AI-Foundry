      "### Insights:\n",
      "1. **Calories**: The caloric intake shows some fluctuations, suggesting variability in daily caloric consumption.\n",
      "2. **Protein**: The protein intake appears relatively stable but varies slightly day-to-day.\n",
      "3. **Carbohydrates**: Carbs have a consistent trend, with some peaks that may correspond to higher-calorie days.\n",
      "4. **Fats**: The fat intake shows variability much like calories but remains in a specific range.\n",

    "4. **Security** ‚Äì Monitor usage, limit access to code interpreter if dealing with proprietary data.\n"
